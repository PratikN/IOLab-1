Due Dates & Late Policy

All homework assignments are due before 12pm on the submission date. 

Please submit all homework assignments via Git as normal. If you have issues submitting via Git, please submit via bCourses. Further instructions for submission will also be given during class.

There is a 20% penalty for each day an assignment is late. Our policy is not to extend due dates beyond their originally specified date, except under certain extenuating circumstances, which we will determine on a case-by-case basis. Please let us know as soon as possible if think you have any extenuating circumstances that will prevent you from submitting an assignment on time. **Please note that a heavy workload does not merit a deadline extension. We are designing the assignments to give you plenty of time to complete them. If you need help with an assignment, please ask on bCourses, come to office hours (TBD), or reach out to us to set up a meeting time.
